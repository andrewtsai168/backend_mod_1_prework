## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

When creating your own method, it allows me to run that certain command over and over again.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Andrew")
